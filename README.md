# Weather App

## Tasks

1. Create a drop down list with some cities (include at least 5 different one - you can pick your favourite ones :) ) and create a table.  Changing the value of the drop down list should change the table to show the weather data (temperature, sky conditions, humidity) of the chosen city.
    - When we open up the page, there is a dropdown list with at least 5 cities in it
    - When we choose a city from the dropdown, the weather of this city is showing up

2. Extend the previous exercise to show not your favourite cities  but create a simple input field with autocomplete feature (so when the user starts typing, a list of cities appear which matches that search).
    - When we type in the dropdown, the list is filtered to the cities starting with the substring
